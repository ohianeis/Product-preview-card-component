#Questions
 I would like to know suggestions as to the code that they are wrong or that they would be better off otherwise.
 At the beginning of everything in the css I give html and body the properties width: 90%, max-width: 1000px and margin: auto to get a focus of all this, I am not sure if this is the best way to achieve this.
 Thanks
